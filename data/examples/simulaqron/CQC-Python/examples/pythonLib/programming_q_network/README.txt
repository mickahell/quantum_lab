Alice and Bob will in this example generate a key and use this to send a message. All the communication will pass through Eve who will try to intercept the message. Alice and Bob don't know distribute a key securely using QKD, so Alice just generates a key and sends this to Bob by encoding the key in a qubit. Alice encodes the key by applying an Pauli-X operation depending on the value of the key.

Can you help Alice and Bob with a better scheme?
